# 🧾 Simple To-Do List CLI App

A simple and lightweight **Command-Line To-Do List App** built in Python.  
I created this project to practice:

- Writing clean and simple Python code  
- Building small CLI tools  
- Working step-by-step with **Git**  
- Creating commits for each feature  
- Publishing and tagging my first app on **GitHub**

This project helped me understand version control, Git workflows, and how to ship a small but functional app.
